# hello-world

Good day, fellow coders!

My name is Corey and I am a front-end web-dev. I am 30 years old (oh my God! I'm so old!). I currently work with HTML, CSS, Javascript and looking at other languages to work with and learn, obviously. I love true crime podcasts and bing listen to them as I work. Hopefully I get to work with some of you and make some great friends.
